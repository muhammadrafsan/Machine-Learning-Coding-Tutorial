# Machine Learning Coding Tutorial

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Coding Tutorial** repository! This project is designed to provide an easy-to-follow introduction to machine learning concepts using Python. You'll find resources, datasets, and Jupyter notebooks to help you understand and apply basic machine learning techniques.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- **`diabetes.csv`**: The dataset used for this tutorial, containing data related to diabetes (sourced from public datasets). You will use this data to perform various machine learning tasks, from preprocessing to building predictive models.
  
- **`ML_Coding_Session_1.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook containing code for:
  - Data Loading
  - Data Pre-processing
  - Feature Engineering
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn`
  
More tutorials will be added as the project progresses!

## 🚀 Getting Started
